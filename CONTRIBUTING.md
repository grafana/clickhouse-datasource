## Development setup

### Getting started

Clone this repository into your local environment. The frontend code lives in the `src` folder, alongside the [plugin.json file](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/metadata/). The backend Go code is in the `pkg` folder. To build this plugin refer to [Build a plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/)

### Running the development version

Before you can set up the plugin, you need to set up your environment by following [Set up your environment](https://grafana.com/tutorials/build-a-data-source-backend-plugin/#set-up-your-environment).

#### Compiling the backend

You can use [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage) to compile and test the Go backend.

```sh
mage test # run all Go test cases
mage build:backend && mage reloadPlugin # builds and reloads the plugin in Grafana
```

#### Compiling the frontend

You can build and test the frontend by using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn test # run all test cases
yarn dev # builds and puts the output at ./dist
```

You can also have `yarn` watch for changes and automatically recompile them:

```sh
yarn watch
```
